First, instead of kneeling on the ground while you work with your plants, you can put a part of the cardboard box beneath you thus <i>protecting your work clothes</i>. In addition to this, you can also use it as a <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Kill-Weeds"> method for killing weeds</a>. Place cardboard pieces over the critical parts of your garden and cover it with mulch. After a couple of days, weeds will be killed due to generated heat and the lack of Sun. Lastly, you can also store your gardening tools in leftover moving boxes.</p>
